# fast-repl

A version of the "app" leiningen template that includes a dev/user namespace with REPL utilities that I always copy when creating new projects.

The included dev/user namespace makes it possible to avoid REPL restarts.

This is a template for personal use. Even though you may find it useful, YMMV.
